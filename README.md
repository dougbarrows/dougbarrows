**Background**  
After receiving a BSc in Biology from Duke University, I moved to New York for a PhD in Pharmacology at Columbia University. Upon completing the PhD in 2016, I came to Rockefeller Univeristy as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of David Allis, where I studied aberrant chromatin regulation in bladder cancer. 

In 2020, I joined the Bioinformatics Resource Center where I continue to be interested in chromatin biology, leading to the development of the profileplyr R Bioconductor package.  As a member of the core, the types of data I work on have expanded to include CUT&RUN/ChIPseq, bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, and CRISPR screen datasets. Additionally, I am particularly interested in making our analyses more accessible to the researchers we work with through the use of graphical user interfaces. 

**Team Roles**: Next generation sequencing analysis and the development of graphical user interfaces for analysis pipeline outputs
